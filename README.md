## Projects/Exercises from studying Electrical & Computer Engineering in the National Technichal University of Athens
- Project in Databases:  
Design of a Database which stores information for a Pharmaceutical Company implemented in mysql and a front-end/back-end development for a user interface using php, html, css.

- Advanced Programming Languages:  
Six programming exercises for a course of advanced programming languages concerning:  
(1) haskell implementation of tarjans algorithm for articulation points (intended to learn and exercise haskell's lazyness)  
(3) A formal-verification of a simple c program using frama-c  
(4) a type inference program written in haskell for the simple l-calculus using the algorithm of the most general unifier  
(5) an interpreter for a "denotational semantics" language, both for call-by-name and call-by-value evaluation implemented in haskell  
(6) an indirectly threaded vm bytecode-interpreter for the esoteric language "Befunge-93", written in c using GNU-compiler instructions in-order to increase execution speed  
and finally  
(7) a python script that plays an online game and suceeds, plus a site and server-side api that simulates this game (using php, html, befunge-intrpreter)

- Operational Systems Lab:  
Three exercises for the advanced laboratory of operational systems concerning:  
(1) a policy instructor and a policy applier for processes handled by linux cgroups  
(2) development of a linux driver for a sensor device  
(3) a tcp/ip chat plus a cryptographic interface visible to the physical machine from a vm, using QEMU VM and virtIO protocol.
