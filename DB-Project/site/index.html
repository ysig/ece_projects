   <h2>About us ...</h2>
   <p>
      Community pharmacists work at the frontline  of healthcare in cities, towns and villages across Great Britain. They work from their own pharmacies or out of local healthcare centres and doctor's surgeries.

      As a community pharmacist your job would be all about helping the public, assessing their conditions and making decisions about which medicines they should take. You'll be involved in dispensing medicines and offering your patients advice and practical help on keeping healthy. It is a very responsible job and community pharmacists tend to be highly respected members of their communities.

      Community pharmacists are also taking on more of the clinical roles that have traditionally been undertaken by doctors, such as the management of asthma and diabetes as well as blood pressure testing. They also help people give up smoking, alter their diets to make them healthier and advise on sexual health matters.

      Some community pharmacists own their own businesses and enjoy the challenges of financial management and responsibility for staff, stock and premises that this brings. Others work for large high street pharmacy chains and have the opportunity to move around within an established company structure.
